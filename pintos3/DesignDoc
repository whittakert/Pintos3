	*** We used the pintos3 code provided for us ***
	--> We will document here and in our code where we implement our own code
	and what is provided for us. 
	
			PAGE TABLE MANAGEMENT
			=====================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A0: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

	--> With the pintos3 starter code, that we were instructed
	to start with, we were provided with the follow structs...

	1. In page.h
	/* Virtual page. */
	struct page 
	  {
	    /* Immutable members. */
	    void *addr;                 /* User virtual address. */
	    bool read_only;             /* Read-only page? */
	    struct thread *thread;      /* Owning thread. */

	    /* Accessed only in owning process context. */
	    struct hash_elem hash_elem; /* struct thread `pages' hash element. */

	    /* Set only in owning process context with frame->frame_lock held.
	       Cleared only with scan_lock and frame->frame_lock held. */
	    struct frame *frame;        /* Page frame. */

	    /* Swap information, protected by frame->frame_lock. */
	    block_sector_t sector;       /* Starting sector of swap area, or -1. */
	    
	    /* Memory-mapped file information, protected by frame->frame_lock. */
	    bool private;               /* False to write back to file,
		                           true to write back to swap. */
	    struct file *file;          /* File. */
	    off_t file_offset;          /* Offset in file. */
	    off_t file_bytes;           /* Bytes to read/write, 1...PGSIZE. */
	  };

	2. In frame.h
	/* A physical frame. */
	struct frame 
	  {
	    struct lock lock;           /* Prevent simultaneous access. */
	    void *base;                 /* Kernel virtual base address. */
	    struct page *page;          /* Mapped process page, if any. */
	  };


---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A1: In a few paragraphs, describe your code for locating the frame,
>> if any, that contains the data of a given page.
	
	--> I think that this is done in try_frame_alloc_and_lock (struct page *page) 
	for us??? not sure... in frame.c
	
  This might have been done in the starter code? need to look into deeper

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A2: When two user processes both need a new frame at the same time,
>> how are races avoided?

	--> You can see in process.c, setup_stack() uses a lock to make sure
	that when allocating allocating a frame for a new page.
	frame_alloc_and_lock (page) --> try_frame_alloc_and_lock (page) -->
	where we actually aquire the lock. This was implemented in the pintos3
	starter code. 

		       PAGING TO AND FROM DISK
		       =======================

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B1: When a frame is required but none is free, some frame must be
>> evicted.  Describe your code for choosing a frame to evict.

	The frame is first checked for a valid file. If there is no valid file,
	simply swap the frame. If there is a valid file, check the dirty bit to
	see if there is data to write to the disk. If there is data, meaning
	that the file is 'dirty' then check if the frame is private. If it is,
	then write to the disk, but if it is not, then write to the file. If 
	the frame was successfully swapped or written to the file, then it was
	reset to NULL for reuse.

>> B2: Explain your heuristic for deciding whether a page fault for an
>> invalid virtual address should cause the stack to be extended into
>> the page that faulted.

			 MEMORY MAPPED FILES
			 ===================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> C1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

	--> With the pintos3 starter code, that we were instructed
	to start with, we were provided with the follow struct...

	1. In syscall.c
	/* Binds a mapping id to a region of memory and a file. */
	struct mapping
	  {
	    struct list_elem elem;      /* List element. */
	    int handle;                 /* Mapping id. */
	    struct file *file;          /* File. */
	    uint8_t *base;              /* Start of memory mapping. */
	    size_t page_cnt;            /* Number of pages mapped. */
	  };

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> C2: Describe how memory mapped files integrate into your virtual
>> memory subsystem.  Explain how the page fault and eviction
>> processes differ between swap pages and other pages.

	--> With the mapping structure we are able to integrate our files 
	into memory. Within the structure, we have a pointer to the file, the 
	"base" or where we start memory mapping and also a count for how many
	pages we map.
	

>> C3: Explain how you determine whether a new file mapping overlaps
>> any existing segment.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> C4: Mappings created with "mmap" have similar semantics to those of
>> data demand-paged from executables, except that "mmap" mappings are
>> written back to their original files, not to swap.  This implies
>> that much of their implementation can be shared.  Explain why your
>> implementation either does or does not share much of the code for
>> the two situations.

			   SURVEY QUESTIONS
			   ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any one of the three problems

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave
>> you greater insight into some aspect of OS design?

>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in

>> Do you have any suggestions for the TAs to more effectively assist
